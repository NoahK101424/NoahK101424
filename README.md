## Hi there 👋
Name: Noah Kim (he/him) -- 
I have taken ECS, Programming I, and AP CSA at Lane tech so far, but this is my first time using github! Some hobbies I have are playing video games, reading, or hanging out with my friends. I hope to learn a lot more about AI and computer science in the days to come!
